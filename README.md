# Self Driving Car Learning Projects

**This Repo respect to Udacity, Coursera, MIT Honor Code.** Some of my projects is inspired by programming assignments from Udacity, Coursera, MIT. And some of the projects that I had finished may out of my personal preference on some particular area, like deep learning, SLAM and Kalman Filter, etc. Some projects may be haven't update to this github repo but will soon finish. Thank you Udacity Faculties and classmates. 

The projects would so far organized in order of terms where it so far mainly based on Udacity self-driving car projects, but will soon add some projects beyond the courses has provided. And some of my codes were totally original.
